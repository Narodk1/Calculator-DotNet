<h1>C# Calculator </h1>
<p>In this project, we will be creating a simple calculator using C# programming language.
A calculator is a useful tool that allows us to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With the help of C# and the .
NET framework, we can create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input numbers and perform these mathematical operations with ease.

To create this calculator, we will be using Windows Forms, which is a graphical user interface toolkit that is built into the .NET framework. Windows Forms provides us with various controls such as buttons, text boxes, and labels that we can use to create our calculator's interface.

Our calculator will have a simple layout, with numeric buttons, arithmetic operation buttons, and a text box to display the result. The user will be able to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation to perform. The calculator will then display the result in the text box.

In the next sections, we will be discussing the steps to create this calculator and the code snippets required to implement it. Let's get started!</p>
